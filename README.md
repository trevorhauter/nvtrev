# nvTrev - From one dummy to another

nvTrev is the hottest new nvim config on the market. With nvTrev, anybody will be able to code just like the legendary Trevor Hauter! This is not meant to be a base config for others to use however they want (although, they could). It's literally just my config.

Full disclosure, I created this following Primagens tutorial. You'd best watch it if you'd like to know how I got here. I've done a ton of customization since then, but if you're a beginner like me, that video is very helpful!

### Plugins
We have all kinds of plugins in nvTrev, the current configuration can be found in [packer.lua](https://github.com/trevorhauter/nvtrev/blob/main/lua/trev_is_cool/packer.lua). We have...

- [Ale](https://github.com/dense-analysis/ale) - For linting!
- [fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive) - To enable git interactions right inside of nvTrev!
- [lsp-zero](https://github.com/VonHeikemen/lsp-zero.nvim) - For LSPs baby! (along with whatever other packer plugins are included in the default lsp-zero config)
- [harpoon](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/harpoon) - To keep our files close to us and easily jump between them
- [nerdcommenter](https://github.com/preservim/nerdcommenter) - To easily be able to comment out lines
- [mason](https://github.com/williamboman/mason.nvim) - (In tandem with lsp-zero) so we can install an lsp server as easy as a packer plugin!
- [nvim-tree](https://github.com/nvim-tree/nvim-tree.lua) - To help us navigate the file tree whenever we need it
- [nvim-treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter) - For syntax highlighting!
- [sainnhe/everforest](https://github.com/sainnhe/everforest) - Because every IDE needs a beautiful theme!
- [symbols-outline](https://github.com/simrat39/symbols-outline.nvim) - To know where you are in your file (I'm not really sure about this one honestly. Good chance I remove it)
- [Telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) - To help us find the files we need
- [undotree](https://github.com/mbbill/undotree) - To visualize the history of our files (I've never used this)
- [vim-airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline) - To give us a beautiful (and informative!) status bar
- [vim-gitgutter](https://github.com/airblade/vim-gitgutter) - Because I want to see git diff markers every time I make a change in a file!
