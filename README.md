# nvTrev - From one dummy to another

nvTrev is my hottes new nvim config on the market. With this readme, anybody will be able to code just like the legendary Trevor Hauter (once it's complete)!

### The initial setup
DISCLAIMER: I'm still working on this config, so I'm not going to flesh out this readme yet. But I will soon, I promise!
I'm going to include the information that I do know in this readme, but there's a lot that I don't know!
- I made this repo from Primagens video. You'd best watch it if you'd like to know how I got here
