# nvTrev - From one dummy to another

nvTrev is the hottest new nvim config on the market. With nvTrev, anybody will be able to code just like the legendary Trevor Hauter (once it's complete)!

### Getting started
- Quickstart tutorial - https://github.com/trevorhauter/nvtrev/wiki/Quickstart

### The setup
DISCLAIMER: I'm still working on this config, so I'm not going to flesh out this readme yet. But I will soon, I promise!

Here's what I have so far...
- I made this repo from Primagens video. You'd best watch it if you'd like to know how I got here.
